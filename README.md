San Diego Top spots is a project that was  done in basic Javascrpt and HTML.This  project was a fun and interactive project.
It required the basic knowledge of java and htlm and an undrstanding of Jquery. Jquery is used in this project to pull from the web the 
locations of the spot the user of the app want to go to and pin it on  google maps.
This project was a challenge but it was a great was to start traing on hoe to use librarys and other calls that we need for later on.
